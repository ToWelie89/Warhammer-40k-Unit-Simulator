Warhammer-40k-Unit-Simulator
============================

This a Windows application created with the framework Windows Forms (C#.NET). The purpsose of the application is to be some kind of simulator for the classic board game Warhammer 40'000. It's a pretty complex and broad game with lots of rules to take into concern with lots of different units where each unit have their own characteristics and attributes. The point of the simulator was to be to simulate battles between units with a game engine that keeps track of all the different rules. When the engine is complete it could be used in an implementation of a full Warhammer 40k game, that uses the exact same rules as the original game.
